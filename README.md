# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to know how different theater projects fared depending on their premiere date and their financing objectives.
## Analysis and Challenges
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
A pivot table was first made where it was filtered by category and starting year, in order to have a count of outcomes, where the number of successful, failed, canceled projects and their total per month were shown to be analyzed. Finally, a linear graph was generated that showed the behavior of theatrical projects due to their start month. ![Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch](path/to/Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.PNG)
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
In a new excel sheet, outcomes were analyzed according to the collection goal of each project using the "COUNTIFS ()" function where the count of successful, failed and canceled works was performed according to the collection goal. Finally a linear graph was made. ![Outcomes_vs_Goals](path/to/Outcomes_vs_Goals.PNG)
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
One of the challenges I faced was using Excel's "COUNTIFS ()" function because multiple conditionals were used that changed by slightly in each row and column. The data had to be manually and carefully changed depending on the fundraising goals and whether the fundraiser was successful, failed, or canceled.
## Results
Based on the launch date, it can be concluded that most successful plays started in the month of May and June, on the other hand it can be seen that few productions start in the months of March and September, it is also observed that the majority of works canceled were in January. From the analysis of Outcomes based on Goals, it can be concluded that most successful projects had fundraising goals below $ 15,000, so the higher the fundraising goal, the more likely it is to fail. One of the limitations of using excel is that you have to move between sheets and in the analysis of projects similar to this, you can get lost among so much information. Other table and graph that can be generated is one where outcomes are measured according to keywords found in the blurb.
